    excerpt: "

We are used to getting SMS and Email Alerts when a transaction takes place in our Bank Account or Credit Card. But no one Alerts us when a transaction takes place in our Wallet - like on a NFT airdrop or when you receive a expected payment.
 
If you wish to spend your time on something more usefull than refreshing your wallet balance then subscribe to @CardanoAdvisor

 
To subscribe for Wallet Alerts, follow the Bot and DM: **Wallet StakeID** . Whenever there is a transaction, the Bot will send you a DM mentioning the new Wallet Balance.

    title: "How can SPOs ensure that their Pool is found?"
    excerpt: "
The Bot uses Machine Learning to find the best matches. To increase the chance that your Pool is found, please consider the following:

 

    Pool performance: No Missed Slots, Pledge is met, Relays online

 

    Follow the Bot to get tagged. For non followers, only the Pool description Metadata is analyzed but not the Timeline

 

    Twitter profile contains the Pool Ticker and Location. The Ticker should ideally be a separate word e.g. **SNSKY Pool** and not **SNSKYPool**

 

    Twitter profile description is machine readable e.g. **AFR!CA** is not recognised **Africa**

 
That's it. The Rest is taken care by the Bot!

 
If you have done everything right, the Bot will suggest you, your own Pool as one of the best matches. Test it out!"

    excerpt: "
All Pools are competing with each other for delegators. Do you wish to know, how your growth is in comparision to your immediate peer Pools?

 
The Bot can evaluate your Pools growth over the last Epoch, in relation to other Pools close to you with similar Stake.
Seems interesting or? Just follow the Bot and DM
